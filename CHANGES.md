# Changes

## Unreleased - 2026-08-15

Changes since v0.8.1.

### 🚀 Features

- Add exact pagination and join admission (63f68a0).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Resolve npm audit vulnerabilities (a6a4b51).

## 0.8.1 - 2026-08-14

Corrects the incomplete `0.8.0` package release with the merged `main` runtime,
generated artifacts, and documentation.

### 📝 Documentation

- Require current password to change email credentials (bfba651).

### ✨ Built-in Teams

- Add runtime-owned Teams for Capsule collaboration: multi-Team memberships,
  admin lifecycle, email-bound Join links, membership application roles, and
  explicit Team decisions in table and File ACLs. Teams are built in but do
  not select a current Team or automatically partition Capsule data; Sporades
  never sends Join-link email. See the [Built-in Teams reference](https://mgscox.github.io/sporades/reference/teams).
